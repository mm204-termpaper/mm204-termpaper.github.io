                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The primary function of the kidneys is removing toxic by-products of the metabolism by
                        filtration of the blood. The blood system includes the transfer of nutrients from the
                        gastrointestinal tract to all body cells (i.e. pertaining to mass transport) and regulating
                        body temperature(i.e. heat energy transfer), and maintaining blood pH. Depreciation of
                        renal efficiency in transporting substances creates a need to have an artificial
                        mechanism for carrying out a normal kidney's functionality. Thus, 'Dialysis' came up. It
                        works on the principles of the diffusion of solutes and ultra-filtration of fluid across a
                        semi-permeable membrane. Therefore, blood is purified using a machine called a
                        dialyzer. The major transport phenomenon in dialysis is diffusion, driven by a
                        concentration gradient. To restore the patient's fluid balance, however, a
                        trans-membrane pressure must be applied such that convection comes into play. In the
                        description of mass transfer in dialyzers, there is small and middle molecule transport.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                        Our analysis starts with studying the different transport processes (diffusion, convection
                        and adsorption) and the differences in solute removal of different molecular weights.
                        Through theoretical analysis, we would be investigating the influence on solute removal
                        of dialyzer flow directions, the flow rates and the flow distributions in the removal of
                        solutes, and the different driving forces for small and middle molecule transport, i.e.
                        concentration and pressure

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The urinary system consists of two kidneys, which filter the blood and deliver urine produced to the two ureters. From the ureters, urine is transferred to the urinary bladder, which is excreted, through the urethra during urination. The kidneys are bean-shaped organs about 11 cm long, 4 to 5 cm wide and 2 to 3 cm wide and lie dormant within the retro peritoneum in the abdomen. The smallest kidney function unit is the uriniferous cone, each containing a nephron and a collection tube. Approximately 1 and 1.3 million nephrons are present in each kidney. One nephron is later composed of part of the blood vessels (glomerulus), part of the fluid (Bowman's capsule), proximal tubule, Henley's loop, and distal tubule. Several nephrons are drawn by a single collection tube, which grows downstream and into the Bellini canal and spreads the papilla of the kidneys. Extensive kidney function removes toxic products of metabolism and other molecules smaller than 69000 Da (i.e., smaller than albumin) by filtering the blood flowing through glomerulus. They also regulate body composition and body fluids. Specifically, the reuptake of salts (Na +, K +, Cl-), glucose, creatine, protein and water occurs in chunks. As a result of this removal and conservation function, the kidneys also contribute to the regulation of blood pressure, hemodynamics, and acid-base balance. In addition, the kidneys have endocrine function: They produce the hormones rennin, erythropoietin, and prostaglandin and help convert Vitamin D into dihydroxycholecalciferol, a substance that regulates calcium transport.</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The average adult has a blood volume of about 5l, which is about 7% of total body weight. Blood is a diamond to pump black blood. The primary functions of the blood system include the transfer of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract to all cells of the body and thereafter, delivering the waste of these cells to the digestive organs. Oxygen (O2) is taken from the lungs to all cells in the body by hemoglobin to erythrocytes, while carbon dioxide (CO2) is returned to the lungs to be removed by hemoglobin and plasma. In addition to nutrients, blood flow also carries many other metabolites, cellular products, and electrolytes. In addition, the blood has the function of regulating body temperature and maintaining acid-base and osmotic balance of body fluids. Plasma contains water (90%), protein (9%) and inorganic salts, ions, nitrogen, nutrients, and gases (1%). Many plasma proteins exist have different origins and functions (e.g., albumin (69000 Da), bglobulins (80000-1E-6 Da), g-globulins, clotting proteins, and related proteins plasma lipoproteins). Non-nucleated erythrocytes, biconcave-shaped discs, 7.5 mm wide and 1-2 mm thick. Their large quantity of land volume benefits the gas exchange. Erythrocytes are full of hemoglobin, a large protein (68000 Da) made up of four chains of polypeptide, which is tightly bound with iron-containing heme. In regions with high oxygen concentration, a portion of the hemoglobin releases CO2 while the iron binds to O2. Leukocytes use blood flow as a means of transport and only perform their function after diapedesis. Inside the bloodstream, leukocytes are round, while pleomorphic in connective tissue. Their main function is to protect the human body from external influences. They can be divided into two main groups: granulocytes (60-70% neutrophiles, 4% nosinophiles, and 1% basophiles) and agranulocytes (20-25% lymphocytes and 3-8% monocytes). Small thrombocytes (2–4 mm wide), disk-shaped, non-nuclear fragments containing several tubules and granules. They work to reduce the blood flow to the arteries in the endothelium in the event of injury.</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Kidney dysfunction can be divided into three stages in which the kidneys lose their ability to cleanse the blood: acute (hours to days), subacute (months) and chronic kidney failure (years). In contrast to subacute and chronic form, severe kidney failure is often reversible. Uremic syndrome is the result of chemical retention, which is often performed by healthy kidneys, as well as disruption of hormonal and enzymatic homeostasis. As kidney failure progresses, the level of glomerular filtration and the number of active nephrons decreases. The main causes of renal disease are chronic diabetes and high blood pressure, and the most important symptoms are found in the cardiovascular, neurological, hematological, and immune systems.</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Diagnosis of chronic kidney failure is based on indications of decreased kidney function or urinary incontinence. In daily practice, creatinine clearance (95720 ml / min for women and 120725 ml / min for men) is used as a measure of glomerular ultrafiltration and measures the remaining kidney function. Ureum removal, in contrast to creatinine clearance, is highly dependent on protein intake, in the patient’s advanced condition and level of urine flow. However, an increase in serum ureum is an additional useful symptom of chronic kidney failure. As with kidney replacement therapy, three methods are available: kidney transplant from cadaver or live donors, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis. We'll look at the last 2 in this conversation.</h3></div></div>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">With peritoneal dialysis, hypertonic glucose dialysis fluid is inserted into the peritoneal cavity using a permanent peritoneal tube. The peritoneal cavity is the inner space and abdomen surrounded by a serous membrane called the peritoneum (1-1.5 m2). The inevitable membrane that contains mesothelial cells in the interstitium contains tissues that connect capillaries and lymphatic vessels. Among mesothelial cells, intercellular spaces (range 5 nm) are responsible for the mass transfer of solute between dialysis fluid and blood to capillaries. Ultrafiltration is mainly achieved by the osmotic effect of glucose, poly-glucose, or other osmotic agents on dialysate, and occurs through very small pores (diameter 0.5 nm), also called aquaporin. Solute removal and ultrafiltration are mainly determined by the availability of peritoneal membranes. This feature is patient-dependent and can be calculated with a peritoneum equilibration test (PET). After a 2-14 hour stay, the peritoneal cavity is removed and filled with a cycling machine or by hand with the flow of gravity. To assist the patient with fluid exchange, various easy-to-use and automatic equipment is available along with devices to ensure proper, safe and sterile communication with bags or machine. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed continuously (CAPD-Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis, CCPD-Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis) or periodically (DAPD-Daytime Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis, IPD-Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis, NIPD - Nightly Intermittent Peritone</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"> Hemodialysis is a medical procedure that involves the bleaching of a patient's blood through a transplant kidney, also called hemodialyzer. This procedure is performed in an external circuit where one or two needles (or catheters) can be used as access to the patient's arteries. Typical treatment for hemodialysis lasts about 9-15 hours a week, mostly spreading more than three times. It could be in the hospital, in the intensive care unit or at home. Two types of hemodialyzers are used: plate and fiber dialyzers. In a plate dialyzer, membrane sheets are collected together and blood and dialysate flow to the next layer. The priming capacity is almost 30% larger than an empty dialyzer. The latter contains thousands of small capillaries (inner diameter 200 mm and wall thickness 8-40 mm). Blood flows inside the capillaries while dialysate flows against them currently around them. The normal blood flow rate is in the range of 200 to 350 ml / min, and dialysate flow selects twice the blood flow. In addition to the benefits of small blood volume, these dialyzers experience problems such as closure and closure of capillaries. With regard to membrane features, a distinction can be made between low, medium, and high flow side diagrams (ultrafiltration coefficient below 15, between 15 and 40, and over 40 mL / h / mmHg, respectively) and dial areas which sells the lower and upper parts of the other (membranes more than 1.5 m2, respectively). Already, since the beginning of hemodialysis, the challenge for nephrologists has been to find adequate vascular access. Quinton-Scribner shunt using external access, today is only used in patients with severe kidney failure and significant vascular problems. Typically, catheters are used for short-term critical phase of kidney failure. The subcutaneous fistula within the arteria radialis and vena cephalica is still the most effective angioaccess method. Finally, the flow of pressure and pressure narrows the vein, helping with repeated piercing. In the event that vessel conditions are inadequate or fail to stretch (10-30% of patients), a bridge joint between the artery and the appropriate artery is used. Many types of graft materials have been used, including autologous arteries, allografts and synthetic graft. With the recruitment of older people with coronary artery disease at the vascular center, the central catheter, introduced for the first time with intensive dialysis, is becoming increasingly popular in long-term dialysis treatment. Since hemodialysis implies repeated and forced contact of blood with foreign substances, biocompatibility problems are inevitable. Traditionally, biocompatibility interactions are defined as the absence of active or chemical reactions during or after physical contact, body fluids or organ transplant or external equipment. Dialysis-related problems related to biocompatibility mainly due to the occasional nature, use of high blood pressure and the use of dialysis fluid and insoluble membranes. They can be summarized as problems related to the severity of conditions, leukocyte proliferation, leukemia and tuberculosis, leaching, landslides, overactive reactions, cuts, and the opposite transfer of electrolytes or endotoxins from dialysate to the blood. In addition to complications related to vascular access and incompatibility, patients with chronic hemodialysis may also suffer from heart disease, hematological, coagulation, acid-base, pulmonary, infectous, dermatological, neurological, -nutritional and gastrointestinal, ocular, endocrine, and sexual problems.</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Hemodialysis fluid should be considered a temporary extension of the fluid outside the patient's cells due to the process of transfusion on both sides where blood and dialysate flow through the dialyzer. Therefore, the formation of dialysis fluid is very important in achieving the desired purification of blood and body fluids and electrolyte homeostasis. It contains reverse osmosis, dextrose, and various electrolytes such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium-chloride and sodium acetate or sodium bicarbonate. The latter two fulfill the function of dialysate buffer, which is responsible for the correction of metabolic acidosis in uremic patients. Hydrogen ions are fresh after their production, are retained by plasma bicarbonate and can only be removed by various alkaline flux from dialysate into the blood that alter blood bubbles. Aside from the chemical composition, organic and micro-organisms are important. Since the use of the highly permeable membrane for hemodialysis is responsible for reversal or reversal, toxic and pyrogenic substances can pass from dialysate into the bloodstream, leading to a slight reversal. Today, the composition of dialysis fluid is determined by each patient to perform individual dialysis treatment according to personal needs. The actual dialysis equipment ensures the precise separation of the purified water and the concentrated salt, the continuous monitoring of the final formation and the constant maintenance of the required operating values. The hemodialysis system is the culmination of a hydraulic circuit in which tap water is converted into osmosis water circulation, precipitation, water purification and dialysis fluid adjustment. The pretreatment contains running tap water through filters, lubricants, carbon filters, and microfilters. Subsequent treatment problems flow through one or two reversible membranes of osmosis and deionizer, closing the series of ultra filtration and sub microfiltration.</h3></div>
